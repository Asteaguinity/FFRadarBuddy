# FFRadarBuddy
Actor radar with 3D overlay for [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/)  
Program reads information directly from game memory, just like existing DPS meters.

## Memory offsets
Program is based on research done by others, check `MemoryLayout.cs` for details. While I didn't include their code directly or used libraries, I'm still taking advantage of their work.

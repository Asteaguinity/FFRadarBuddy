# FFRadarBuddy
Actor radar with 3D overlay for [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/)  
Program reads information directly from game memory, just like existing DPS meters.  
(All used icons are property of SQUARE-ENIX Ltd. All rights reserved)  

## Memory offsets
Program is based on research done by others, check `MemoryLayout.cs` for details. While I didn't include their code directly or used libraries, I'm still taking advantage of their work.

Keep in mind that presets downloaded by program can be overwriten during update. It can happen occasionally (e.g. hunt list Id updates) and all local edits will be lost.
